# Creative-Technologist-Toolkit
A small library written in Google Closure to do common things fast, useful for rapid prototyping in JavaScript.

This is a work in progress right now so things are subject to change until I actually create a versioned release here on GitHub. This is mainly for myself right now, although some classes may be useful to others too, such as my K-Nearest Neighbour implementation etc. A lot of this code I need to optimize and refactor however, so is more of a brain dump right now. :-) I recommend looking at the full source right now, not any of the minified stuff, which will not be up to date just yet (which is there just for my own testing).

If you like what you see though, feel free to leave a suggestion of what you would like more of in the future - especially if it is a high level component you often finding yourself writing but never got around to standardizing eg visualizing a audio spectogram on canvas etc.
